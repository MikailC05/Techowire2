                    (HP) The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939,
                            and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is
                            now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'. HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing,
                            data storage, and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services.

                                        copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single

                                        people could use to build the computers.
